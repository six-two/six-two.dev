  Yeah, I <i>totally</i> wanted you to see this page. It's not a dead link.
  <br>
  What, you noticed that the page is named "404: Page not found"? ðŸ˜°
  <br>
  Just go away and watch some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=funny+cat+video" title="You know you want to click this link. Why else would you hover over it?">funny cat videos</a>.
  <br>
  Or you could <a href="/contact">tell me</a> how you got here so that I can try to fix it.
