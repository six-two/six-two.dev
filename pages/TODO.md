# TODO
- Create Paypal account for six-two
- Create and upload a cv (pdf?)
- Spell checking
- Report gitlab pages custom 404.html bug

## Nice to have
- Remove the feed
- Compress the pages (https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/119670/how-do-you-serve-jekyll-pages-with-gzip-compression-on-gitlab-pages)
- Convincing Github pages to compress the damn html (compressing css seems to work)
