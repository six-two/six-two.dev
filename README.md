# My website
A simple static website with some information about me.
Made with Jekyll, Markdown, HTML and CSS.

## URL
There are two versions of this website:
 - [Gitlab](https://six-two.gitlab.io/) hosts the stable version. Please use this one.
 - [Github](https://six-two.github.io/) hosts the development version. It might be broken, probably has a lot of spelling errors and may contain incorrect information and partially completed pages.
