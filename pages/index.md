<h2 class="section-header">This website has</h2>
 - Humor. The idea of using it in tooltips was shamelessly copied from <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/" title="This tooltip is not funny, but the link is (probably).">xkcd</a>.
 - Some information about [me](/about "Maybe it's true. Maybe I am a dog that can type. On the internet you can never be sure. But a dog that can create its own website would be pretty impressive.").
 - A list of my official <a href="/contact">online accounts</a>. Do not trust other accounts, that claim to be me.
 - A list of ways to <a href="/donate" title="Don't ask why. Just do it ðŸ˜‰">send me money</a>.
 - A <a href="/work" title="Wow, that sounds like a bad illness or a strange plant.">curriculum vitae</a>.

<h2 class="section-header">Missing features</h2>
I did not have enough time to *improve* my website with common design elements like:
 - Advertisements (especially the ones that are in invisible iframes).
 - "We are using cookies to ..." banners, that block half the page until you click OK.
 - Hundreds of external resources that make the page so slow, that it needs a loading animation.
 - I will not ask you to sign up for some newsletter every time you scroll to the bottom of a page.
 - An unprotected database with your social security number and credit card information.
 - Autoplay videos, that will ~~annoy~~ entertain you, until you can find the close button.
 - &lt;div&gt;Bad html, that somehow still works&lt;/span&gt;
 - And my all time favorite: Aggressive collection and selling of user data.
