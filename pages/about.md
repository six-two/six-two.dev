<h1 class="section-header">About me</h1>
I am a young programmer with an bachelor's degree in IT.
When I am not in front of a monitor I am reading books, jogging, hiking, doing martial arts or I just relax and listen to some podcasts.
And I really love humor, jokes and sarcasm.
But there are also some things I dislike: JavaScript, SQL, Windows and wearing suits are at the top of that list.


<h2 class="section-header">Current goals</h2>
At the time I am focussing on learning all I can about cyber security.
The subject has always been interessting to me, but now I finally have the time, money and background knowledge to really focus on it.

If you know some good resources or want to teach me something just [contact me](/contact).


<h2 class="section-header">Personal information</h2>
<div class="message-box message-long">
  <span>Trigger warnings</span>
  <ul>
    <li>This section may contain a trigger warning. If you are offended by them you should not have read this box.</li>
    <li>This section may make fun of trigger warnings. But since we have a culture of respect and civility on the internet, where people do not get easily outraged and tweet death threats to other people, I am sure that it will be fine.</li>
    <li> This section may contain sarcasm. But you look like a smart person, that would noticed that by now ðŸ˜‰.</li>
