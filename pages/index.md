<h2 class="section-header" id="about">About me</h2>
I am a programmer from Germany.
My current goal is to learn as much about cyber security as I can.
When I am not in a small dark room in front of a glowing monitor (my natural habitat), I am meeting with friends, walking in the nearest forrest or jogging.
